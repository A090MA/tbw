1) The FIPS codes uniquely identify each county and are part of the Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), U.S. Department of Commerce. For more information, see the NIST FIPS publication page.

2) The 2013 rural-urban continuum codes classify metropolitan counties (codes 1 through 3) by size of the Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), and nonmetropolitan counties (codes 4 through 9) by degree of urbanization and proximity to metro areas.
